# TypeScript

- Helps us catch errors during development

- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze code

- Only active during development

- Doesn't provide any performance optimization

## How it Works

1. We write JavaScript code with type annotations
2. Our code gets fed into the TypeScript compilier
3. Our code is executed as JavaScript
